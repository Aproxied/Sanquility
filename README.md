Sanquility [All-Users-Rectify-Actions]
==============================

Greetings; and welcome to the official GitHub Repository of Sanquility.

Sanquility is a relative to a once upon a time project who has wondered
and gotten lost along the beaten path. In hopes of accomplishing what
her older sister couldn't do; she set out on a venture of her own and
with our help; she will accomplish her goal that her sister once had.

Now; we will be straight-foward with you. While we have no intention on
releasing the Source-Code every single time we create a patch or an update;
we will release it on intervals of every two weeks-one month possibly.

*NOTE: IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT WE MAY HALT PUBLIC DEVELOPMENT AT ANY GIVEN
TIME, BE IT FOR LEGAL ISSUES, OR PERSONAL ISSUES.*

*NOTE: Sanquility has the intentions of turning into it's own server at some
point; we will release early stages of the Framework, the Network Handler,
the Core-Engine, possibly some Developer-Tools to help people un-familiar
with Programming assist them in developing their own Sanquility, however at
the same time; when time comes for us we will do an official opening and may
halt on releasing any further source-code unless deemed necessary.*


Compatibility
------------------------------
Sanquility is compatible with the Client that we provide; where most key
elements are programmed from scratch. It took us a very, very long while
to remove many, many referances, but, it's done. Please; use the Client
we provide to ensure your security and game-play is par-to-none.

Recommendations/Requirements
------------------------------
In order to begin using Sanquility; you will have to compile the 
Source-Code yourself using an IDE.

The recommended/required stuff you will need will be listed below.

  -> Visual Studios 2017, can be free or paid. You just need the compiler
  -> .NET 4.5
  -> MySQL 5
  
Please note: There are many other programs or frameworks similar to the above
mentioned that you could use; however; if you do not know what you're doing and
want a set-up with a very low ratio of any errors occuring during set-up, please
use the recommended IDE/Frameworks.

Installation
------------------------------
-> Compile Sanquility.
-> Now, head to `main/data/core/database/main.sql` and launch it in order to set-up the database.
-> Next, copy `main/config/database/database.conf` and paste it in `usr/config/`,
  now adjust the values currently set to your 
  satisfaction.

*Finally*, using the .bat file scripts; you should be able to launch Sanquility
directly from your File Explorer where the .bat files are located in
Sanquility's main directory as long as it's compiled.

Alpha-Testing; STATISTICS!
------------------------------
We are always in need of people to assist us with drastically improving Sanquility.

That's right, we're talking about *you!* The information you provide and submit
to us further enhances our output on where to look!

# Bugs

Bugs are a common part of any game that consist of many, many lines of programming.
If you run into any bugs, please report them on our website under the 
"Support -> Submit a bug", and we will look into it asap. If you can provide how you
came across it exactly; and if it does indeed reproduce the bug on our end; we will
gradually reward you in-game or out-game.

# Alpha/Beta-Testing

We see it quite often these days where many games are released in an un-finished state,
only to follow up with patch after patch, sometimes patches fix bugs, add new features,
or many other fancy follow-ups, or even introduces a brand new bug. We need people to
help us Alpha/Beta-Test everything we put out as soon as we feel like it's stagnant
enough for a player to proceed with it.

# Game-Moderators

Do you have a knack for getting along with players? Enjoy running content endlessly,
until you truly feel like you cannot accomplish anymore? Or maybe you like enforcing
the rules and making sure everybody is playing fair and treating eachother equal;
either way you like it, we're always looking for *Game-Moderators* to help us in
the moderation of Sanquility to make sure everything is running along smoothly
with players; and the game. 

*Note:* *Game-Moderators will be responsible for many various tasks; and will be
required to be online for quite an amount of substantial time. Beings this is a
very, very work in devlopment, players may experience their characters getting
stuck or clipped and may need a Game-Moderator to teleport them, NPC's may not
spawn properly and you may have to spawn it in manually, you may have to make 
decisive actions on punishments; such as banning or muting players.*
